# Hi ![wave](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif) My name is Antonio

### Software Developer

Hey there, I'm Antonio a 23 years old young man. Currently, I'm knee-deep in an apprenticeship journey, splitting my time—40% hitting the books at school and 60% diving into the bustling world of work. You'll find me tucked away in a manufacturer's domain, specializing in aerospace and energy components.

My gig? Well, I'm the one behind the scenes, coding tools that lighten the load for my fellow factory folks. It's all about making their lives a bit easier, you know?

Beyond just punching in and out, my mission is bigger. I'm all about ramping up the quality of our work environment. I want every person in that factory to feel valued and pumped about what they do. Simplifying things, making each day smoother—it's what gets me going.

So yeah, that's me—Antonio, on a mission to sprinkle a little joy and efficiency into the daily grind for everyone around me.

### Skills
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript): 🚀 Started my programming journey with it, so you could say we're pretty tight.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): 🌟 Like a sibling to JavaScript; been with me since the start.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/): 🐍 Got a Discord bot running smoothly with Python; we make a good team.

- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/): 🥧 Familiar territory since it's Python-based. Haven't tinkered with it recently, but might dive back in soon—it's got potential!

- [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/): 📱 Played around with it for fun, but didn't dive too deep since I didn't have a project in mind.

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5) and [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css): 💻 Used it extensively, though it's not my favorite. Takes time, and I prefer more engaging stuff.

- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/): 🗃️ Easy peasy, but not as exciting as some other languages. Still, it's better than HTML and CSS!

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/): 🤔 Dabbled in it a bit, but it's been a while. Might need a refresher on the latest versions.

- [Linux](https://www.linux.org): 🐧 Newbie in this realm, but already picking up lots. Good for now, but always room for improvement.
